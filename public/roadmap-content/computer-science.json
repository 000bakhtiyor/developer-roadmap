    "title": "Pick a Language",
    "description": "You need to pick a programming language to learn the Computer Science concepts. My personal recommendation would be to pick C++ or C and the reason for that is:\n\n*   They allow you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures and algorithms in your bones. In higher level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day to day work, that's terrific, but when you're learning how these low-level data structures are built, it's great to feel close to the metal.\n*   You will be able to find a lot of resources for the topics listed in this roadmap using C or C++. You can find a lot of resources for Python and Java, but they are not as abundant as C++ and C.\n\nGiven below is the list of resources; pick ones relevant to the language of your choice.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It is a weighted graph algorithm, meaning that each edge in the graph has a weight associated with it. The algorithm works by finding the shortest path from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph. It does this by keeping track of the distance from the starting node to each node, and then choosing the node with the shortest distance from the starting node to visit next. It then updates the distance of each node from the starting node, and repeats the process until all nodes have been visited.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The prefix function is the longest prefix that is also a suffix of a substring. The prefix function is used to skip the characters that are already matched. The algorithm is as follows:\n\n*   Compute the prefix function of the substring.\n*   Traverse through the string and substring simultaneously.\n*   If the characters match, increment the index of both the string and substring.\n*   If the characters don't match, increment the index of the string by the value of the prefix function at the index of the substring.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

It is more rigidly balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter)\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Each node stores an extra bit representing \"color\", used to ensure that the tree remains balanced during insertions and deletions.\n\nThese are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below).\n\nIn practice: Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time. Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees; for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java, the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

It is the process of adding redundant data to a database to improve read performance. This is done by adding duplicate data into multiple tables to avoid expensive joins.

DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data. These commands are normally not used by a general user, who should be accessing the database via an application.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The processor accesses the registers within one CPU clock cycle. The processor can decode the instructions and perform operations on the register contents at more than one operation per CPU clock cycle.\n\n**_Memory_** is a hardware device that stores computer programs, instructions, and data. The memory that is internal to the processor is primary memory (RAM), and the memory that is external to the processor is secondary (**Hard Drive**). Primary memory or RAM is a volatile memory, meaning the primary memory data exist when the system's power is on, and the data vanishes as the system is switched off. The primary memory contains the data required by the currently executing program in the CPU. If the data required by the processor is not in primary memory, then the data is transferred from secondary storage to primary memory, and then it is fetched by the processor.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Scheduling Algorithms",
    "description": "CPU Scheduling is the process of selecting a process from the ready queue and allocating the CPU to it. The selection of a process is based on a particular scheduling algorithm. The scheduling algorithm is chosen depending on the type of system and the requirements of the processes.\n\nHere is the list of some of the most commonly used scheduling algorithms:\n\n*   **First Come First Serve (FCFS):** The process that arrives first is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Shortest Job First (SJF):** The process with the smallest execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a non-preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF):** The process with the smallest remaining execution time is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Round Robin (RR):** The process is allocated the CPU for a fixed time slice. The time slice is usually 10 milliseconds. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Priority Scheduling:** The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Multi-level Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Multi-level Feedback Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. If a process is preempted, it is moved to the next queue. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Lottery Scheduling:** The process is allocated the CPU based on a lottery system. It is a preemptive algorithm.\n*   **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling:** The processes are divided into different queues based on their priority. The process with the highest priority is allocated the CPU first. If a process is preempted, it is moved to the next queue. It is a preemptive algorithm.",

    "description": "CPU Interrupts are a way for the CPU to communicate with the rest of the computer. They are a way for the CPU to tell the rest of the computer that it needs to do something. For example, if the CPU is running a program and it needs to read from the keyboard, it will send an interrupt to the keyboard to tell it to send the data to the CPU. The CPU will then wait for the keyboard to send the data and then continue running the program.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
