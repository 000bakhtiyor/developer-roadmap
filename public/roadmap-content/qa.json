    "description": "The phrase \"fit for use or purpose\" sums up quality, which is incredibly difficult to define. It all comes down to fulfilling the requirements and expectations of the consumer in terms of the product's usefulness, design, dependability, durability, and price.\n\nAssurance is nothing more than a confident statement made about a good or service. It is the assurance that a good outcome is guaranteed for a good or service. It offers a warranty that the product will perform faultlessly in accordance with expectations or needs.\n\nQuality Assurance (QA) also known as QA testing is an activity to ensure that an organization provides the best product or service to the customers. QA testing of a software involves the testing of performance, adaptability, and functionality. Yet, software quality assurance extends beyond software quality; it also comprises the quality process used for developing, testing, and release of software products. QA relies on the software development cycle, which includes the management of software requirements, design, coding, testing, and release.",

    "title": "Responsive vs Adaptive",
    "description": "There are two approaches to ensuring a website is optimized for mobile, tablet, laptop and PC screens: responsive design and adaptive design. While both are intended to solve the same problem, they use different strategies.\n\nWhat is responsive design?\n==========================\n\nA website created with responsive design serves up the same site to every device, but that site is fluid and will change its layout and appearance based on the size and orientation of the device.\n\nDevelopers use CSS to ensure each page of the site can reformat based on the size of the user's viewport and only need to create one codebase for the site. They use something called breakpoints to tell the site when to adjust to accommodate different screen sizes.\n\nThe majority of new sites now use responsive, which has been made easier for less experienced designers and developers, thanks to the availability of themes accessible through CMS systems such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.\n\nResponsive design does not offer as much control as adaptive, but takes much less work to both build and maintain. Responsive layouts are also fluid, and whilst adaptive can and do use percentages to give a more fluid feel when scaling, these can again cause a jump when a window is resized.\n\nWhat is adaptive design?\n========================\n\nIn adaptive design, a different website layout is created for each device's screen. As it loads, the site recognizes the size of the screen and serves up the layout that was made for that viewport. In fact, you can create a different user experience for each of six common screen sizes from very small to very large: 320px, 480px, 760px, 960px, 1200px and 1600px.\n\nAdaptive is useful for retrofitting an existing site in order to make it more suitable for mobile phones. This allows you to take control of the design and web development for specific, multiple viewports. The number of viewports that you choose to design for is entirely up to you, your company, and your overall budget. It does, however, afford you a certain amount of control (for example over content and layout) that you will not necessarily have using responsive design.",

    "description": "WebdriverIO is a progressive automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications. It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and stable test suite.\n\nWebdriverIO leverages the power of the WebDriver protocol that is developed and supported by all browser vendors and guarantees a true cross-browser testing experience. While other automation tools require you to download modified browser that aren't used by actual users or emulate user behavior by injecting JavaScript, WebdriverIO relies on a common agreed standard for automation that is properly tested and ensures compatibility for decades to come.\n\nDuring the development of this automation standard the web has changed a lot and many of the requirements that developers have today to test their web application can not be fulfilled using WebDriver anymore. While some of the core contributors of this project help support the next generation of the WebDriver protocol, WebdriverIO provides an alternative automation solution based on the Chrome DevTools protocol. This allows the user to seamlessly switch between conventional commands based on WebDriver and powerful browser interactions through Puppeteer.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

As the core engine is actually protocol agnostic, it is perfectly possible to implement support for other protocols. For example, Gatling currently also ships JMS support.\n\nGatling’s architecture is asynchronous as long as the underlying protocol, such as HTTP, can be implemented in a non blocking way. This kind of architecture lets us implement virtual users as messages instead of dedicated threads, making them very resource cheap. Thus, running thousands of concurrent virtual users is not an issue.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "Security testing is a process intended to reveal flaws in the security mechanisms of an information system that protect data and maintain functionality as intended. Due to the logical limitations of security testing, passing the security testing process is not an indication that no flaws exist or that the system adequately satisfies the security requirements.\n\nTypical security requirements may include specific elements of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, availability, authorization and non-repudiation. Actual security requirements tested depend on the security requirements implemented by the system. Security testing as a term has a number of different meanings and can be completed in a number of different ways. As such, a Security Taxonomy helps us to understand these different approaches and meanings by providing a base level to work from.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "description": "`Authentication` is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be. Authentication in the context of web applications is commonly performed by submitting a username or ID and one or more items of private information that only a given user should know.\n\n`Authorization` may be defined as \"the process of verifying that a requested action or service is approved for a specific entity\" (NIST). `Authorization` is distinct from authentication which is the process of verifying an entity's identity. When designing and developing a software solution, it is important to keep these distinctions in mind. A user who has been authenticated (perhaps by providing a username and password) is often not authorized to access every resource and perform every action that is technically possible through a system.\n\nFor example, a web app may have both regular users and admins, with the admins being able to perform actions the average user is not privileged to do so, even though they have been authenticated. Additionally, authentication is not always required for accessing resources; an unauthenticated user may be authorized to access certain public resources, such as an image or login page, or even an entire web app.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Many vulnerability scanners are equipped to accept results from network discovery and network port and service identification, which reduces the amount of work needed for vulnerability scanning.\n\nAlso, some scanners can perform their own network discovery and network port and service identification. Vulnerability scanning can help identify outdated software versions, missing patches, and misconfigurations, and validate compliance with or deviations from an organization’s security policy.\n\nThis is done by identifying the operating systems and major software applications running on the hosts and matching them with information on known vulnerabilities stored in the scanners’ vulnerability databases.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

With each commit, code is built and tested.\n\nContinuous Delivery is a software engineering method in which a team develops software products in a short cycle. It ensures that software can be easily released at any time. The main aim of continuous delivery is to build, test, and release software with good speed and frequency.
