    "description": "Angular is a popular open-source front-end web application framework developed by Google. It is written in TypeScript and allows developers to build dynamic, single-page web applications with ease. Angular provides a comprehensive set of features for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces, making it a powerful tool for modern web development.\n\nOne of the key features of Angular is its use of components, which are reusable building blocks for creating web applications. Components encapsulate the HTML, CSS, and TypeScript code needed to define a specific part of a web page, making it easier to manage and maintain complex applications. Angular also includes a powerful dependency injection system, which helps manage the dependencies between different parts of an application and promotes code reusability. Additionally, Angular provides tools for routing, form handling, and state management, making it a versatile framework for building a wide range of web applications.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

The lifecycle continues with change detection, as Angular checks to see when data-bound properties change, and updates both the view and the component instance as needed. The lifecycle ends when Angular destroys the component instance and removes its rendered template from the DOM. Directives have a similar lifecycle, as Angular creates, updates, and destroys instances in the course of execution.\n\nYour application can use lifecycle hook methods to tap into key events in the lifecycle of a component or directive to initialize new instances, initiate change detection when needed, respond to updates during change detection, and clean up before deletion of instances.\n\nThe following life cycle hooks of angular are :\n\n`OnChanges` , `OnInit` , `DoCheck` , `OnDestroy` , `AfterContentInit` , `AfterContentChecked` , `AfterViewInit` , `AfterViewChecked`\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

So we can perform various operations such as updating the user interface, or passing the JSON response.\n\nThere are 4 stages for a life cycle of an observable.\n\n*   Creation\n*   Subscription\n*   Execution\n*   Destruction\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Operators",
    "description": "RxJS is mostly useful for its operators, even though the Observable is the foundation. Operators are the essential pieces that allow complex asynchronous code to be easily composed in a declarative manner.\n\nOperators are functions. There are two kinds of operators:\n\n**Pipeable Operators** are the kind that can be piped to Observables using the syntax observableInstance.pipe(operator()). These include, filter(...), and mergeMap(...). When called, they do not change the existing Observable instance. Instead, they return a new Observable, whose subscription logic is based on the first Observable.\n\nA Pipeable Operator is essentially a pure function which takes one Observable as input and generates another Observable as output. Subscribing to the output Observable will also subscribe to the input Observable.\n\n**Creation Operators** are the other kind of operator, which can be called as standalone functions to create a new Observable. For example: of(1, 2, 3) creates an observable that will emit 1, 2, and 3, one right after another. Creation operators will be discussed in more detail in a later section.\n\nPiping\n------\n\nPipeable operators are functions, so they could be used like ordinary functions: op()(obs) — but in practice, there tend to be many of them convolved together, and quickly become unreadable: op4()(op3()(op2()(op1()(obs)))). For that reason, Observables have a method called .pipe() that accomplishes the same thing while being much easier to read:\n\n     obs.pipe(op1(), op2(), op3(), op4());\n    \n\nCreation Operators\n------------------\n\n**What are creation operators?** Distinct from pipeable operators, creation operators are functions that can be used to create an Observable with some common predefined behavior or by joining other Observables.\n\nA typical example of a creation operator would be the interval function. It takes a number (not an Observable) as input argument, and produces an Observable as output:\n\n    import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n    \n    const observable = interval(1000 /* number of milliseconds */);\n    \n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Rate Limiting",
    "description": "Rate limiting in RxJS refers to the practice of restricting the rate at which events or data can be emitted from an observable. This can be useful in situations where the rate of incoming data is higher than the rate at which it can be processed, or where there are limits on the number of requests that can be made to a server. There are a few different operators in RxJS that can be used for rate limiting, such as throttleTime and sampleTime. These operators can be used to limit the rate of emissions from an observable by discarding emissions that occur too frequently. Another operator is auditTime it emits the last value from the source Observable during periodic time windows.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

    "title": "Transformation",
    "description": "In RxJS, \"transformation\" refers to the process of modifying or manipulating the data emitted by an Observable. There are a variety of methods available in RxJS that can be used to transform the data emitted by an Observable, including:\n\n*   map: applies a function to each item emitted by the Observable and emits the resulting value\n*   mergeMap: applies a function to each item emitted by the Observable, and then merges the resulting Observables into a single Observable\n*   switchMap: applies a function to each item emitted by the Observable, and then switches to the latest resulting Observable\n*   concatMap: applies a function to each item emitted by the Observable, and then concatenates the resulting Observables into a single Observable\n*   exhaustMap: applies a function to each item emitted by the Observable, but ignores subsequent emissions until the current Observable completes\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many methods available in RxJS for transforming the data emitted by an Observable. Each method has its own specific use case, and the best method to use will depend on the requirements of your application.\n\nHere are the official documentation links for the RxJS transformation methods:\n\nYou can find more information and examples on these methods in the official RxJS documentation. Additionally, you can find more operators on [https://rxjs.dev/api/operators](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators) and you can also find more information on the library as a whole on [https://rxjs.dev/](https://rxjs.dev/)",

Jasmine is the testing library which structures individual tests into specifications (“specs”) and suites. And Karma is the test runner, which enables the different browsers to run the tests mentioned by Jasmine and the browsers will finally report the test results back.",
