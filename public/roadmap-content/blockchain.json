Developers can use Gosh like they use Git and turn any Gosh repository into a DAO and configure it to suit their needs. They can also fund their DAO and use DeFi applications to incentivize code security.\n\nWith Gosh, builds are no longer at risk. From source code on Gosh to Docker container, developers can be sure that their build is safe. Mission-critical applications can also write their scripts as formally verified smart contracts to get rid of holes in the CI/CD process.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

The foundation aims to develop and support a self-sufficient blockchain ecosystem with non-custodial wallet options, transparent transaction histories, interchain transactions, staking on validator nodes, and a native decentralized exchange, among others.\n\nThe MENA region entrepreneurs are considered pioneers in global crypto trend adoption, and the foundation's customizable approach is well-suited to bridging different dimensions of market participants. The platform has a panel of industry leaders and seasoned investors, and the project is generating attention in MENA due to its transactional management possibilities, higher security, and inbound governmental database projects. The foundation will work with ecosystem participants to offer new products such as NFT marketplace, derivative exchange, fiat-backed stablecoin, and others to come with the potential to become a bridge towards wide adoption of CBDC in the UAE, other MENA countries and globally.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

Users don’t rely on a centralized group of people, such as a bank, to make decisions and allow transactions to flow through. Because the system is decentralized, users know that transactions will never be denied for non-custodial reasons.\n\nThis decentralization enables use-cases that were previously impossible, such as parametric insurance, decentralized finance, and decentralized organizations (DAOs), among a few. This allows developers to build products that provide immediate value without having to go through a bureaucratic process of applications, approvals, and general red tape.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
