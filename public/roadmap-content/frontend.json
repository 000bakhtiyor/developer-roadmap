In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).\n\nFlutter consists of two important parts:\n\n*   An SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).\n*   A Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs. To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years.\n\nDart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications.\n\nIf you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dart's syntax to JavaScript.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

It stands for Push, Render, Pre-cache, and Lazy-load, and it involves the following steps:\n\n*   Push: Prioritize the delivery of critical resources, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to the client as early as possible.\n*   Render: Start rendering the web page as soon as the critical resources are received, even if some non-critical resources are still being downloaded.\n*   Pre-cache: Pre-cache non-critical resources in the background so that they are available when needed.\n*   Lazy-load: Defer the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed, such as when the user scrolls to them or interacts with them.\n\nThe PRPL pattern is designed to improve the perceived performance of a web page by reducing the time it takes for the page to become interactive. It is particularly useful for applications that are served over slow or unreliable networks, as it allows the page to render as quickly as possible and then gradually load the remaining resources.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between a client and a server, and is typically used in applications that require high-speed, low-latency communication, such as online gaming and real-time data streaming.\n\nWeb Sockets utilizes a persistent connection between a client and a server, allowing for continuous data exchange without the need for the client to send additional requests to the server. This makes it more efficient and faster than other technologies, such as HTTP, which require a new request to be sent for each piece of data.\n\nWeb Sockets is supported by most modern web browsers and can be used with a variety of programming languages and frameworks.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",

It uses an HTTP connection to send a stream of data from the server to the client, and the client can listen for these events and take action when they are received.\n\nSSE is useful for applications that require real-time updates, such as chat systems, stock tickers, and social media feeds. It is a simple and efficient way to establish a long-lived connection between a client and a server, and it is supported by most modern web browsers.\n\nTo use SSE, the client must create an EventSource object and specify the URL of the server-side script that will send the events. The server can then send events by writing them to the response stream with the proper formatting.\n\nVisit the following resources to learn more:",
