![Leaderboard Page](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/accordion-rbvpo.png)

We are introducing a new leaderboard page that will show the most active users on the platform. This will help users to see who is contributing the most to the community and motivate them to participate more.

- Top users will be shown based on the number of contributions they have made.
- Users will be able to see their own rank on the leaderboard.
- Users will be able to see the rank of other users on the leaderboard.
- Top performers will be highlighted on the leaderboard.

You can check out the leaderboard page [here](/leaderboard).
