# Jinja2

Jinja2 is a popular templating engine for Python that allows you to generate dynamic HTML, XML, or other text formats. It features a simple yet powerful syntax with template inheritance, filters, macros, and automatic HTML escaping for security. Commonly used with web frameworks like Flask, Jinja2 enables developers to embed Python-like expressions and logic within template files while maintaining a clean separation between application logic and presentation.
